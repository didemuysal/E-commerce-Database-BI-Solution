# E-commerce Database & Business Intelligence (BI) Platform
Designed and optimized a database for an e-commerce platform and developed a proof-of-concept business intelligence solution using Microsoft SQL Server Analysis Services (SSAS).

### Group Project - Database Design, Optimization, and BI Solution Development
This repository contains the project files and documentation for an e-commerce database and business intelligence platform. The goal of the project was to design, normalize, and optimize a database for an e-commerce platform and develop a proof-of-concept BI platform using Microsoft SQL Server Analysis Services (SSAS).

## Database Normalization and Optimization
## 1. Normalization to 3NF
We started by normalizing three initial tables to Third Normal Form (3NF) to reduce redundancy and improve data integrity:

Removed partial dependencies and transitive dependencies.
Ensured that all non-key attributes are fully functionally dependent on the primary key.

## 2. Creating Normalized Tables
After the normalization process, the newly designed tables were created in the database.

## 3. Data Migration
We migrated all the existing data from the original structure to the new normalized tables while ensuring no data loss.

## 4. Data Integrity Checks
We performed comprehensive checks to ensure data consistency and integrity after the migration. This was done using constraints, triggers, and custom checks.

## 5. Introducing the OrderGroup Entity
We introduced a new entity called OrderGroup to represent grouped orders. Instead of creating a new table for this entity, we added two calculated columns to the OrderItem table:

TotalLineItems: Represents the total number of items in an order group.
SavedTotal: The total saved from discounts or promotions.
## 6. Indexing for Performance Optimization
To improve query performance, we implemented:

Clustered indexes on primary key columns to optimize data retrieval.
Non-clustered indexes on frequently queried columns to speed up search operations.
Subtree cost for "Total Sales per Customer" reduced by 61%
Subtree cost for "Total Sales per Product" reduced by 13%
Subtree cost for "Total Sales per City" reduced by 35%

Key Features Implemented
## 7. Stored Procedures
We developed two stored procedures to handle order creation:

prCreateOrderGroup: Handles the creation of a new order group.
prCreateOrderItem: Inserts a new order item, linked to an order group.
## 8. Error Handling
Robust error-handling mechanisms were added to the stored procedures and database transactions to ensure data consistency and recoverability in case of failures.

Business Intelligence Platform
## 9. Data Source View (DSV)
We designed a Data Source View (DSV) in SSAS to create an abstraction of the database and define the relationships between tables.

## 10. Cube Design
We created a multidimensional cube with the following components:

Measures: Sales amount, total items, total orders, and revenue.
Dimensions: Time, customer, product, and geography.
## 11. BI Solution Export
The BI solution was exported and packaged for deployment in a Microsoft SQL Server environment, providing actionable insights through cube measures and dimensions.

Some Examples:
Quantity Ordered by Date Quantity Ordered by Date

Sales and Quantity by Day Sales and Quantity by day

Sales and Quantity by Product Sales and Quantity by Product
